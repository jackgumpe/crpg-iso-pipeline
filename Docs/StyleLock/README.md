# Style Lock Kit

Place 10–20 **reference images** here that share the exact orthographic, pulled-back isometric camera.
Use 2–3 of these as references in each generation. Include 2–3 of your own best "golden base" outputs.

Tips:
- Prefer wide shots (full area), not close-ups
- Favor consistent tile grid visibility
- Keep lighting soft/ambient and baked

This folder is versioned in Git so your references are part of your reproducible pipeline.
